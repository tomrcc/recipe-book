## Ingredients

* 1 seedless orange
* 250 g flour
* 3 eggs
* 200 g sugar
* 16g baking powder
* 90 ml neutral vegetable oil
* 60 ml milk
* 1 tsp vanilla

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C.Grease a cake pan and cover in baking paper.
2. Try pick a thin skinned orange, but any will do (this will prob work with most citrus). Give them a wash, cut into pieces and add to blender.
3. Add sugar, oil, milk, vanilla, and egg to blender.
4. Blend till smooth.
5. Sift in flour and baking powder. Incorporate these with as little mixing as possible. Overmixing at this stage isn't good, but we don't want any pockets of flour either.
6. Pour batter into cake pan.
7. Bake in oven for approx 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
8. Allow to cool in pan for 10 minutes.
