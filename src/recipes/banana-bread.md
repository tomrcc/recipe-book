## Ingredients

* 3 – Bananas (ripe & large sized) – Use 1 1/2 cups (345 g) of mashed bananas to be exact.
* 1/2 Cup – Vegetable Oil – 115 ml – Use a neutral tasting vegetable oil such as corn or canola.
* 2 – Large Eggs – 114 grams – Large eggs
* 1 Cup Sugar – 200 g
* 2 Cups All Purpose Flour – 240 g
* 1 Teaspoon – Vanilla Extract – 5 ml
* 1 Teaspoon – Baking Soda – 5 g
* 1 Teaspoon – Baking Powder – 4 g
* 1/2 Teaspoon – Salt – 3 g

## Method

* Preheat oven to 160°C
* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Lightly beat eggs.
* Mix bananas, vegetable oil, eggs and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Stir until completely mixed.
* Mix in the remaining ingredients. Stir until the batter is fully mixed.
* **Optional** – Add things like choc, nuts, dried fruit now.
* Pour the finished batter into a nonstick bread pan. Smooth out the top of the batter within the bread pan.
* Bake in the oven at 160°C for 65-70 minutes or until golden brown.
* Take out of the oven and **let the banana bread cool down in the bread pan for 10 minutes**. Do not remove the banana bread from the bread pan during this 10 minute cool down period. Use oven mitts as the bread pan will be very hot coming out of the oven. *Do not skip this step as the “cool down” completes the baking process.*
* After 10 minutes, remove the banana bread from the bread pan. Place the banana bread on a cooling rack in order to completely cool. This cool down may take 1-2 hours. Gently slide a silicon spatula between the banana bread and the bread pan walls if the banana bread is stuck in the pan.
