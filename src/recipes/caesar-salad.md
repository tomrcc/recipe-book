## Ingredients

* Peppercorns
* Garlic
* Capers
* Anchovies
* Egg yolks
* Dijon
* Olive oil
* Hot sauce
* Worcestershire sauce
* Red wine vinegar
* Parmesan (finely grated)
* Lemon

## Method

1. Add egg yolk, dijon and freshly minced garlic to a salad serving bowl.
2. Fork together, then add (slowly at first) olive oil until it feels like its about to split, or just starts to split. Adding more liquid in step 4 will give the split oil something to bind onto and the dressing will no longer be split.
3. Chop or crush anchovies and capers until minced.
4. Add the rest of the ingredients to taste.
5. Only add leaves and toss right before serving otherwise the leaves will wilt.
